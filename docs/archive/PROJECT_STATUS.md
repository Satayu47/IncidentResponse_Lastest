# Project Status: Organized and Ready

## ✅ Organization Complete

The project has been reorganized into a clean, logical structure:

### Scripts
- `scripts/experiments/` - All experiment scripts
- `scripts/visualization/` - Chart generation
- `scripts/testing/` - Test utilities  
- `scripts/setup/` - Setup helpers

### Documentation
- `docs/guides/` - User guides and quick starts
- `docs/architecture/` - System architecture docs
- `docs/experiments/` - Experiment documentation

### Reports
- `reports/papers/` - IEEE-formatted reports (ready for paper)
- `reports/visualizations/` - All charts and images
- `reports/results/` - JSON test results
- `reports/summaries/` - Summary documents

## ✅ Duplicates Removed

- Old accuracy result JSON files (kept latest only)
- Old multi-incident JSON files
- Duplicate status/setup documentation
- Redundant baseline comparison files

## ✅ Content Improved

Key files rewritten to sound more natural:
- README.md - More conversational, less AI-like
- Rubric section - Academic but natural tone
- Claude setup guide - Step-by-step, practical
- Code comments - Simplified and clearer
