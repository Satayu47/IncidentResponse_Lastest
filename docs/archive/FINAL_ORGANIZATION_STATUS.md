# Project Organization Complete

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. File Organization
- Scripts organized into logical folders (experiments, visualization, testing, setup)
- Documentation categorized (guides, architecture, experiments)
- Reports sorted (papers, visualizations, results, summaries)
- Root directory cleaned up

### 2. Duplicate Removal
- Removed old test result JSON files (kept latest only)
- Removed duplicate status/setup documentation files
- Cleaned up redundant baseline comparison docs

### 3. Content Improvement
- README.md rewritten to sound more natural
- Rubric section rewritten for academic paper
- Claude setup guide made more conversational
- Code comments simplified
